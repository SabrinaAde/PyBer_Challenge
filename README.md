Overview of the analysis:
The purpose of the analysis is to gain the different fare rates of rides, and drivers based on city type. City type is broken down into three categories being rurual, suburban and urban.

Each city has different trends in ride sharing Urban in general had the highest amount of ride shareing while rural shows the lowest amounts of ride sharing and suburburan is moderate ride sharing. This makes sense based on relative population of each city type. The shown on the below graph encomposes the total rides based on each city, total drivers, average fare and total fare by city type.

Summary:
In terms of suggestion to the CEO here are the following based on the data:
-company should spend time in maintaining and expanding ride sharing in urban areas as urban gives the highest total of ride sharing as well as drivers available.
-comapany should look into improving ride sharing in rural areas. As although there are fewer ride sharing in rural areas most customers on average are paying more per ride. Which means that ride sharing in rural areas might be viewed as a novelty or luxury where customers are willing to pay a premium to access. 
-Suburban areas had the highest amount of total fares (19356) which means people were paying more per ride than in urban area. This is indicative as subururn areas had 5 times less drivers than urban areas.
